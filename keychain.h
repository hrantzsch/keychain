/*! \brief A thin wrapper to provide cross-platform access to the operating
 *         system's credentials storage.
 *
 * keychain provides the functions getPassword, setPassword, and deletePassword.
 *
 * All of these functions require three input parameters to identify the
 * credential that should be retrieved or manipulated: `package`, `service`, and
 * `user`. These identifiers will be mangled differently on each OS to
 * correspond to the OS API.
 * While none of the supported OSes has specific requirements to the format
 * identifiers, the reverse domain name format is recommended for the `package`
 * parameter in order to correspond with conventions.
 *
 * In addition, each function expects an instance of `keychain::Error` as an
 * output parameter to indicate success or failure. Note that previous states of
 * the Error are ignored and potentially overwritten.
 *
 * Also note that all three functions are blocking (potentially indefinitely)
 * for example if the OS prompts the user to unlock their credentials storage.
